# Assignment 3 – Nearest Neighbor Classification

**Course:** DATA-51100 Statistical Programming  
**Student:** Sai Kumar Murarishetti  

## 📌 Objective

This assignment implements a basic Nearest Neighbor classifier in Python using NumPy. 
The script compares test data points against training data to classify them based on the nearest neighbor and calculates classification accuracy.

## 📂 Files Included

- `NearestNeighbor.py` – Python script implementing Nearest Neighbor algorithm.
- `iris-testing-data.csv` – Dataset used for testing.
- `Assignment 3 Outputs.pdf` – Output screenshots/results submitted for grading.
- `iris-training-data.csv` – Required for script execution (must be added manually).

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. Ensure both `iris-training-data.csv` and `iris-testing-data.csv` are in the same folder.
2. Run the script : python NearestNeighbor.py

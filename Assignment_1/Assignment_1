Statistical Programming

📊 Statistical Programming – Assignment 1
Course: DATA 51100 Student: Sai Kumar Murarishetti

📝 Assignment Overview
This is the first programming assignment for the Statistical Programming course. The objective of this assignment is to implement a Python program that calculates the mean and variance of a sequence of numbers using an online algorithm (incremental approach), without storing the entire dataset.

The user is prompted to enter a number n, and the program calculates the mean and variance for all integers from 1 to n using a numerically stable method. The loop continues until the user enters a negative number.

🔢 Key Concepts
Mean (Average): Sum of numbers divided by the count.
Variance: Measures the spread of the numbers from the mean.
Online Algorithm: Allows updating statistics incrementally as new data comes in, efficient for large data or streams.
🧮 How the Program Works
Prompts the user for an integer input.
For values ≥ 0:
Uses a while loop to iteratively compute:
Mean: updated at each step using xn = xn + (i - xn)/i
Variance: updated using a formula derived from Welford’s method.
Stops when a negative number is entered.
Displays the final computed mean and variance for each valid input.
🚀 How to Run
Run the script in your terminal or any Python environment: python OnlineStats.py
